"""We know that "A picture is worth a thousand words". So let's calculate the worth of a video using this!

Suppose a video has 24 frames (or pictures) per second, and has a duration of 
ï¿½
S seconds. We know that each frame is worth 
1000
1000 words. So, how many words is this video worth in total?"""
